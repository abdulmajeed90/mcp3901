* Pseudocode
1. Connections
   RESET = RESET, SDO -> SDI, CS -> CS, SCK -> SCK
2. Data to send
   DATA = 0b00000001 = 0x1
3. Initialize outputs
   RESET = 0, SDO = 0, CS = 1, SCK = 0
4. CS = 0
5. Send command
   1. for i = 0-7
      # Set data on pin and strobe clock
      1. SDO = DATA[i]
      2. SCK = 1
      3. SCK = 0
   2. sleep for 100mS
6. Infinite loop send clock to receive data
   1. SDO = 1
   2. SDO = 0
